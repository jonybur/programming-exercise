# To-Do List Interview Task

## Objective

The goal of this task is to assess your proficiency with React and problem-solving in the context of a small application. You will build a To-Do List with multiple features, progressing through three levels of complexity. Each level introduces new challenges designed to test different aspects of your React and JavaScript skills.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Objective**: Create a basic to-do list that allows users to add tasks and display them.
2. **Requirements**:
   - Users should be able to add new tasks.
   - Tasks should be displayed in the order they are added.
   - Users can delete tasks from the list.
   - Implement a dropdown to toggle between sorting tasks alphabetically and by the time they were added.

## Instructions

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. The project is set up with a skeleton in `App.js`. You can start building your solution directly in this file.
3. Follow the progression from Level A to Level C, implementing the required features.
4. Use `useState` and `useEffect` for managing the component state.

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. You should now be able to start building the To-Do List functionality.

## Time Allocation

- You should aim to complete the task in **45 minutes**, progressing through the levels as far as you can.

Good luck!
